# a fresh repo for my experiments with EGNNs.

I am starting to get the hang of this prototyping/training/evaluating/iterating thing, and the last repo for my EGNN stuff was a mess.
starting fresh, keeping this one clean, being smarter about my workflows, and building tools to help me turn the crank more quickly.
